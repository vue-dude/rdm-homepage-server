With the labfolder ELN software researchers can handle the scientific documentation effortlessly with a lot of support for compliance with academic standards.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p>For Max Planck researchers exist <strong>two usage scenarios:</strong> (1) labfolder can be set up as an <strong>in-house service at the respective institute</strong>. The emerging data will be stored in locally operated server environments. (2) All Max Planck researchers (as well as their collaboration partners) have the possibility to use the <strong>central&nbsp;MPG labfolder installation</strong> which is operated and supported by the MPDL with emerging data stored at the computer center GWDG in G&ouml;ttingen, Germany.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/en/content/tools/labfolder/170803_labfolder.webp\" style=\"margin-left:10%; width:80%\" /></p>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p><span class=\"body-link\">Get more information about <a href=\"https://labfolder.mpdl.mpg.de/home/\" target=\"_blank\">labfolder at the Max Planck Society</a></span></p>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Get in touch with the <span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"mailto:labfolder@mpdl.mpg.de\">MPDL labfolder team</a></span></div>\n"}
