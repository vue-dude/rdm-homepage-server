Costs for data management (software, hardware, technical expertise) are often eligible in project grants. Even without a formal obligation, you may do yourself a favor creating a data management plan for your own.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Data management plans shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as bureaucratic hurdles or compliance &quot;check lists&rdquo;, but as an <strong>integral part of research practice</strong>. They are (or should be)&nbsp;<strong>living documents</strong>&nbsp;that might require revisions or updates as research progresses and data are acquired and processed: Details become clear, initial plans may change, unforeseen collaboration opportunities could arise.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><strong>Data management plans usually cover the following aspects:</strong></div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Data description and collection</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which data will be generated (types, formats, volume)? Types could include e.g. numeric, textual, image, audio, video. Formats are often indicated by the filename extension. Proprietary formats (created by scientific instruments and/or specific software applications) should be converted or at least be convertable to open and standard formats. Volume can be described in terms of number of files as well as total file size.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will the project re-use existing data? If not, has this possibility been explored?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Documentation and metadata</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which information will be attached to the data? What is needed for others (also beyond your own scientific field) to find, understand and potentially re-use your data? Documentation might include definition of variables, details of methodology and approaches to quality control.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Metadata should be comprehensive and follow community standards whenever available and applicable.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">File organization and nomenclature might be described in this section.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Storage and backup</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Where will data be stored during the project? At your institute? In Keeper? At the GWDG? At the MPCDF? Or somewhere else? How and how frequently will data be backed up? Multiple backups at different locations are strongly recommended.</li>\n\t\t<li>How are data, that are generated in the field, are transferred to more secure locations?</li>\n\t\t<li>How will data be recovered in case of incidents?</li>\n\t\t<li>How will data be protected to prevent unauthorized access, particularly for sensitive data (e.g. containing personal information)?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Legal and ethical requirements</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In case of personal data, how can compliance with applicable regulations and laws (e.g. GDPR) be assured?</li>\n\t\t<li>Are there other restrictions on sharing data, such as intellectual property rights, purchased data or plans to seek for patents?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data sharing and long-term preservation</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which data will be made freely available, and when? How will potential re-users find out if, where and how datasets are available? Will data be deposited in a repository or shared by other means?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will data be assigned with persistent identifiers? Will licenses clarify conditions of re-use?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will access to data be limited, e.g. restricted to certain communities or subject of data sharing agreements?</li>\n\t\t<li>Also for data that aren&rsquo;t shared: How is long-term preservation assured and for how long (beyond the lifetime of the project)?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Responsibilities and resources</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Who will be responsible for data management, implementing the DMP and updating it? This could be one or several named person(s) or an institution. Different parts of the data management process may be spread over several roles.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How are responsibilities defined and/or split in collaborative research projects?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which resources (e.g. software, hardware, technical expertise, expected amount of effort) are required for data management? Which costs are involved, and how will these be covered?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\" style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">This information is often preceded by administrative data (e.g. funder, project, grant reference number, principal investigator, version of DMP). The level of detail appropriate or required in DMPs will differ between projects and scientific fields, particularly regarding data documentation.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\" style=\"text-align:center\">Tools for the Creation of Data Management Plans</div>\n\n<p><strong>These online tools are available (registration required):</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"distance px4\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">DMPonline</a></span>&nbsp;by the British Digital Curation Centre (DCC).
