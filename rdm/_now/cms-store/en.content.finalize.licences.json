{"key":"en.content.finalize.licences","value":"<div class=\"headline-main\">Data Licenses</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Published research data have limited potential for re-use if users do not know what they can do with the data. It is therefore crucial to <strong>assign a license to a dataset</strong>. Community standards and good scientific practice should still be observed even if not enforced by licenses. All following licenses allow <strong>open re-use of data</strong>, subject to certain conditions.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\" style=\"text-align:center\">Creative Commons</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons licenses</a>&nbsp;</span>were initially designed for cultural material, but in the latest version 4.0 are <strong>also suitable for scientific data</strong>. While not specifically addressing characteristics of (scientific) data, they are widely known and adopted, hence users will be familiar with their meaning. All licenses come with a short summary (in many languages) understandable without legal background, as well as the full license text.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Recommended licenses are&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;(Attribution) or&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CC0</a></strong>&nbsp;(Public Domain, No Rights Reserved). CC BY obliges re-users to give credit to data producers (without implying endorsement). CC0 doesn&rsquo;t include such a formal obligation but good scientific practice still requires giving due credit.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Other conditions can be imposed but aren&rsquo;t recommended<strong> </strong>for various reasons: SA (ShareAlike) imposes that works derived from data are distributed under the same license (&ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;) &ndash; this can pose problems if data from various sources provided with different licenses are aggregated. NC (NonCommercial) prohibits commercial use, but it can be difficult to define what&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;represents commercial (re-)use. ND (NoDerivatives) allows re-users to distribute the data only in the original form, without any adaptions. While this could make sense in scenarios e.g. with personal data, it mostly narrows down dramatically the possibilities for re-use.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\" style=\"text-align:center\">Open Data Commons</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Commons licenses</a></span>&nbsp;were <strong>designed specifically for data</strong>. One key feature is that different licenses can be applied to a database as a whole and to its content &ndash; this is relevant for example if an image database compiles images from various sources with some images copyrighted. These licenses also have human-readable summaries as well as full legal text.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Analogous to the above-mentioned CC licenses are <strong><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">ODC-By</a> </strong>(Open Data Commons Attribution License)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">PDDL</a></strong>&nbsp;(Public Domain Dedication and License). Open Data Commons licenses are better suited to tag data but not as widely used as CC licenses.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px12\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\" style=\"text-align:center\">Other Licenses</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"http://www.govdata.de/lizenzen\" target=\"_blank\">Datenlizenz Deutschland</a></span>&nbsp;was created <strong>for administrative government data</strong>. While being exceedingly short and precise, moreover consistent with international open data standards and having license text in both German and English, an international audience may not be familiar with these licenses.</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
