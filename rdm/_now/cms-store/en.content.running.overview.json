Storing data&nbsp;solely&nbsp;on a local harddisk, laptop or USB stick is very risky and not recommended as storage media may deteriorate, could be lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. Backups should be performed<strong> regularly</strong>. <strong>Automatic backups</strong> are better than manual ones which you might forget. Also verify that backups are working, and that you have access to these files.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px4\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Numerous&nbsp;<strong>MPDL services</strong>&nbsp;are available to Max Planck researchers and &ndash; upon invitation &ndash; their external collaborators.
